# A Version of the RealWord Example App in Elm

`elm-spa-version` is version, or variation, of an Elm Single Page App (SPA) implementation of the RealWorld Example App. It offers a variation of module decomposition that matches that of the application I work on for my day job. This variation was arrived at before [The Life of a File](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpDsk374LDE). This is merely offered as a potential reference for co-workers and others that ask me questions and say "an example of that might be helpful." I offer no confident assertions :bow:.

The example done by [Richard Feldman](https://github.com/rtfeldman/) will be far more idiomatic to the overall Elm Community, [elm-spa-example](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example).
